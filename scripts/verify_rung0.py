"""Executable verification of rung 0's assay-reliability claims (PROCESS section 3).

Every check here recomputes a reported number from the run's own artifacts alone -- no
cluster access, no trust in any write-up -- and prints the claim beside the recomputed
value and a verdict. Trust comes from re-derivation the reader performs, not from
narrative the writer asserts: a reviewer who runs this has re-derived the evidence rather
than read about it, and a number recomputed at read time cannot drift the way a number
transcribed across documents can.

    uv run python scripts/verify_rung0.py
    uv run python scripts/verify_rung0.py --task-dir path/to/a/run

The default task directory is ``docs/tasks/rung0-assay-reliability``, where the run's
tables sit UNCOMMITTED between the run and promotion (PROCESS, "What reaches GitHub, and
when"); ``--task-dir`` points the same battery at any directory holding one run's output,
which is how the synthetic-data example run and the continuous-integration copy are
checked. The notebook ``docs/tasks/rung0-assay-reliability/verify.ipynb`` recomputes the
same claims in self-contained cells -- standard-library hashing, direct table reads,
nothing imported from this project -- and runs this script only as its final cross-check;
``tests/test_verify_rung0.py`` runs this battery in continuous integration, so the
branch's green does not depend on anyone opening the notebook.

The two reliabilities are checked as one battery over two gene sets. The all-gene family
is the reproducibility of a mostly-null profile; the responder family is the
reproducibility of the response itself, over the genes the condition's FIRST plate group
called differentially expressed. They carry the same statistics under the ``all_`` and
``responder_`` prefixes of one summary row, so every check below runs twice.

What is NOT checkable locally, stated rather than hidden:

* The 1,026 Tahoe pseudobulk shards live on cluster scratch and are far too large to
  commit. Shard integrity therefore reduces here to the committed manifest's content
  hash: the battery recomputes the tranche's ``content_hash`` from the committed
  ``.manifest.txt`` exactly as ``scripts/register_tranche.py`` computed it, which pins
  which bytes the run read without holding those bytes.
* A promoted copy under ``results/`` does not exist until after gate 2. When that
  directory is absent the promotion checks are SKIPPED with a note, not failed -- before
  promotion there is nothing to disagree with, and a battery that failed there would be
  reporting on the calendar rather than on the evidence.
* The permutation check is a separate cluster job. When its outputs are absent those
  checks are SKIPPED the same way.
* The committed per-gene noise table is a bounded sample (two million rows of 175 million).
  No promoted number is read from it: the pooled between-plate share is recomputed from the
  per-condition sums the run committed for every condition, and the sample serves the
  row-wise identity check, the strata table, and the figures.
