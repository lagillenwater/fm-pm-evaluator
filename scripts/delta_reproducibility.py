"""Delta reproducibility ceiling: how noisy is the real Tahoe delta itself?

This is rung 0 of the ladder in docs/SPEC.md: a reference every other rung reads its score
against. Split each (line, drug, dose) triple's replicate plates into two halves, aggregate
each half's delta, and correlate the two halves over every gene. That split-half
correlation is the delta's own test-retest reliability -- the most any predictor at rung 1
could score against the real delta. Spearman-Brown then lifts the half-data number to the
full-data reliability rung 1 is read against.

Reuses the DuckDB-over-local-parquet path (the Tahoe DE table is already local or on
scratch), so it needs no GPU.
