"""Promote a run's output into committed evidence (SPEC rule 1; PROCESS §1 'Promote').

A log is not evidence; a result becomes evidence when a claim cites it, and citing means
a ``results/<task-slug>/`` copy with a schema-validated ``PromotedResult`` beside it.
Three fields cannot be reconstructed later and are written here: whether the tree was
clean, the producing commit, and the artifact's checksum. Promotion REFUSES when the
task-side copy and an existing promoted copy differ -- an artifact must not change under
its claim.

The producing commit is the commit the RUN was made at, read from the ``<result>.params.json``
sidecar every run writes beside its result (``git_sha``), or given as ``--code-commit`` when a
result has no sidecar. It is never the commit promotion happens at: code lands between a run
and its promotion, and a record naming the later commit names code that cannot reproduce the
result. The promotion commit is recorded too, separately, as ``promotion_commit``.

Usage (rung 0):
    uv run python scripts/promote_result.py \
        --task rung0-assay-reliability \
        --result docs/tasks/rung0-assay-reliability/rung0_reliability.csv \
        --script scripts/delta_reproducibility.py \
        --input gene_panel=/path/to/common_panel.txt \
        --input drug_cids=/path/to/tahoe_target_cids.txt \
        --seed 0 --data-commit <tranche content_hash> \
        --arg tranche_id=tahoe100m-pseudobulk-de.v1 --job-id <slurm id> \
        --log results/rung0-assay-reliability/<job log>

``--input`` takes ``LABEL=PATH``, so the promoted record's ``inputs`` dict is keyed by a durable
label rather than a scratch path; a bare ``PATH`` (no ``=``) is still accepted for back-compat
and keyed by the path string, as before.
