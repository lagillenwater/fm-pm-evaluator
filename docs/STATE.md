# Project state

**Reads against** [`docs/SPEC.md`](SPEC.md).
The spec says what each rung must establish and what a passing result means; this document says where each one stands.
It carries no history: a rung's result belongs here, how it came to be belongs in git and in that rung's spec.

**As of** 2026-09-10.

A number not carried here with its provenance record is not evidence.
Promotion means a result in `results/<task-slug>/` with a `<result>.provenance.json` beside it recording the commit, job and inputs that produced it — project rule 1.
Rung 0's dose-fixed run is complete and verified (72 of 74 battery checks; the two failures are the superseded dose-pooled promotion of 2026-09-02, whose withdrawal is pending) and awaits its re-audit and the estimand declaration before promotion. The one promoted result is that superseded pooled number. No rung is closed.

## Ladder status

| Rung | What the spec requires | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — assay reliability | Two reproducibility ceilings clearing their nulls at the assay's full extent — all genes, and each condition's responders — with replicate noise decomposed into plate and cell-sampling parts | **Run complete and verified, not yet promoted.** Dose held fixed, plates split alternately, on branch `rung0-assay-reliability` ([design](tasks/rung0-assay-reliability/design.md) · [summary](tasks/rung0-assay-reliability/summary.ipynb) · [verification](tasks/rung0-assay-reliability/verification.md)): over 7,641 replicated (line, drug, dose) triples the all-gene split-half is **0.065** (Spearman-Brown **0.122**) and the responder split-half **0.430** (**0.601**) over 6,654, both clearing their floors at p = 0.0005. The responder ceiling is a 5 uM property: **0.577** there against 0.136 and 0.035 at the two lower doses, which the dose figure shows and the strata table carries; which aggregate a later rung divides by is the open declaration. Noise: the published standard errors exceed the across-plate variance for all genes, so no plate component is detectable there. The superseded dose-pooled promotion (0.118 / 0.559, wrong provenance commit) awaits withdrawal |
| 1 — held-out line | Prediction beating a floor and recovering a planted signal, as a fraction of rung 0 | Not started |
| 2 — bulk read by a single-cell model | A synthesised population landing near the same material's real single cells, clearing a mismatched-line null | Not started |
| 3 — cross-platform | Retention separable from a scrambled-line control | Not started |
| 4 — GDSC2 viability | Interaction above zero after correction, against the screen-agreement ceiling | Not started |
| 5 — organoid viability | The transfer number, on a frozen embargoed holdout | Not started |
| 6 — prospective | A registered prediction holding on organoids screened afterwards | Not started |

A rung closes when its result is promoted with provenance, this table records it, and the project-rule tests for the steps it touches pass.


## What this repository holds today

| Present | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Schema, determinism and adapter scaffolding, with tests | The apparatus a rung is added to exists; nothing here yet produces a measurement |
| One promoted result, `results/rung0-assay-reliability/` | Rung 0 is the first work held to the spec's rules. The number is provisional and its provenance record says why; the rung is not closed |
| `docs/adapter_contract.md` and `docs/environment.md`, predating this spec | Neither has been reconciled against it. The rung that first depends on either brings it into line rather than a sweep that touches everything at once |

## Where things live

- **Results** `results/<task-slug>/<result>.csv` with `<result>.provenance.json` beside it. No provenance record, no evidence.
- **Figures** produced by a run into `docs/tasks/<slug>/figures/`, never drawn by hand, each drawn from a committed table and shown beside its control; declared per step in that task's `design.md`, pointed at from `verification.md`, and walked through in `summary.ipynb`. A figure the project cites is promoted alongside its table.
- **The reviewer's two notebooks** `summary.ipynb` explains the finding step by step with its figures; `verify.ipynb` recomputes every promoted claim inline from the committed artifacts. Both are committed without outputs.
- **Audits** `docs/tasks/<slug>/audit.md`, following the repository standard in [`docs/audit.md`](audit.md).
- **Rung and task specs** `docs/tasks/<slug>/design.md`, one folder per task, arriving with the work it specifies.
- **Decisions** dated and appended to the bottom of the task's own `design.md` and `plan.md`, so a reversal travels with the document it reverses.
- **Rules and their tests** `docs/SPEC.md` and `tests/test_project_rules.py`.
- **The summary a reader opens first** `README.md`, which restates this document's status line and the ladder from `docs/SPEC.md`. It moves whenever either does.
