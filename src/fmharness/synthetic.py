"""Synthetic replicate pools with planted, known answers.

Rung 0's figures put real data beside a planted answer on shared axes: a histogram of the real
screen shows what the assay looks like, and the same histogram of a pool whose reliability we
chose shows whether the machinery reads it correctly. This module is where that pool comes from,
so the run and its controls plant the same generative model rather than two similar ones.

The model, per (cell line, drug, gene):

    delta = signal + plate_offset + sampling_noise

``signal`` is fixed for the condition (variance ``signal_sd ** 2``), ``plate_offset`` is shared by
every gene on a plate, and ``sampling_noise`` is independent per plate and gene. A split-half
correlation over ``p`` plates per half therefore has expectation

    signal_sd ** 2 / (signal_sd ** 2 + noise_sd ** 2 / p)

which is the closed form the score controls check against. Inverting it: to plant a FULL-data
reliability ``R`` over ``n`` plates, set ``noise_sd = sqrt(n * (1 - R) / R)`` with unit signal --
then the half correlation is ``R / (2 - R)`` and Spearman-Brown lifts it back to ``R``.
