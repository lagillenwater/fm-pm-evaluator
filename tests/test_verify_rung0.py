"""The executable verification entry point runs green in continuous integration (PROCESS section 3).

The notebook `docs/tasks/rung0-assay-reliability/verify.ipynb` is committed without outputs so a
reviewer executes it and watches the checks pass themselves; these tests run the same battery so
the branch's green does not depend on anyone opening the notebook. Every check recomputes a
reported number from the run's own artifacts, so a failure here means a document and an artifact
disagree -- the drift class the audits used to catch by reading.

The last test is the design's `document` step negative control. A battery that reports PASS on
evidence somebody altered is measuring nothing, so one number in the summary row is changed and
the real battery is required to fail, naming the claim that moved.

#: The battery is exercised against a run the test session makes itself: the real ``main`` over
#: a synthetic pool with planted plate effects, two dose levels and responders, in three gene
#: slices. That run always exists, so the battery's arithmetic is tested on every checkout;
#: the committed cluster run is checked separately below, and only when its parameter sidecar
#: says it was produced under the schema this battery reads. RUNG0_EXAMPLE_RUN overrides the
#: synthetic run with a directory of a real run's artifacts.
TASK_DIR = REPO / "docs" / "tasks" / "rung0-assay-reliability"

#: Both the summary table's trust map and this task's pull-request description quote the size of
#: the battery. Pinning it here means adding or removing a check forces those transcriptions to be
#: revisited rather than quietly going stale -- the one number in the wave that nothing else
#: guards. Skipped checks are counted: whether the permutation job has run changes what can be
#: checked, never how many claims the battery is answerable for.
